print("Learning from Data: Algorithms analyze data to identify patterns.")
print("Generalization: The model should work on unseen data.")

print("Improvement Over Time: The more data a model is trained on, the better it performs.")

print("            Types of Machine Learning")

print("ML is broadly categorized into three types:")

print("     A. Supervised Learning")

print("The model is trained on labeled data (input-output pairs).")

print("Used for classification (categorizing into classes) and regression (predicting continuous values).")

print("Example 1: Spam Email Classification")
print("Example 2:Package Prediction Based on CGPA")
print("Example 3:House-Price Based on number of rooms and Area in Square unit")


print("     B.Unsupervised Learning")

print("The model is trained on unlabeled data and finds hidden patterns.")

print("Used for clustering (grouping similar items) and association (finding relationships).")

print("Example 1: Customer Segmentation")

print("      A retail company groups customers based on their purchase behavior:")

print("              Group 1: Frequent buyers")

print("              Group 2: Occasional buyers")

print("              Group 3: One-time buyers")

print("        C. Reinforcement Learning")

print("The model learns through rewards and penalties for actions taken in an environment.")

print("Used in robotics, game playing, and self-driving cars.")

print("            Example: AlphaGo (Google's AI playing Go)")

print("              AI learns by playing millions of games, improving over time by learning from past moves.")
